# DIY Surveillance Robot with Live Video Feed

Four years ago, I engineered a Bluetooth-controlled, 4-wheeled robotic vehicle using an Arduino Uno, designed for remote surveillance and mobility‚Äîeven out of sight.
 What sets it apart?
I used two smartphones‚Äîone mounted on the robot to stream video live via Alfred Camera, and another as a controller via Bluetooth. This setup enabled real-time navigation from anywhere, even without visual contact.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Technologies:
Arduino Uno + HC-05 Bluetooth
L298N Motor Driver IC
2x 3.7V Lithium-ion batteries
Breadboard prototyping
Alfred Camera for live video
üí° This project deepened my skills in:
Embedded systems
Wireless communication
Power and motor control
Mobile app interfacing
DIY remote monitoring solutions
üîß Built this from scratch using readily available components and lots of curiosity. It‚Äôs a great example of turning ideas into real-world functional tech!
